# splines

This is an implementation of the idea presented by Cem Yuksel in ["A Class of C2 Interpolating Splines"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3400301).
More information, and a live example can be found at http://www.cemyuksel.com/research/interpolating_splines/

This is a stripped-down version of the example implementation given by Yuksel at http://www.cemyuksel.com/research/interpolating_splines/curves.html. This version uses the plain canvas API rather than WebGL.
